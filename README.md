## What I'm Working On

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just finished my project 'Petrichor
Coffee'. It's a PERN stack web application with a fully functional store and
profile system. I also occasionally update it and add new features, go see whats new!

Mind the spinup time, it's hosted on a free plan.
