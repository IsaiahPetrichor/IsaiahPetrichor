## What I'm Working On

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My current focus is on a full-stack Ecommerce
application like you would see on a small businesses webpage. I'm trying to
incorperate all of my skills and make it the best project I've ever made.

## What I'm Learning

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of my learning time is being spent on Web Security
